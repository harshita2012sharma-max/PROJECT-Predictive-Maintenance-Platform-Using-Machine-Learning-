# Predictive Maintenance Platform

## Overview

The Predictive Maintenance Platform is an end-to-end Machine Learning web application designed to predict equipment failures before they occur. The system analyzes industrial sensor data and provides actionable insights to reduce downtime and optimize maintenance scheduling.

This project demonstrates integration of Machine Learning models into a production-ready web application.

## Problem Statement

Unexpected equipment failures cause:

- Increased downtime
- High repair costs
- Reduced operational efficiency

This system predicts failures in advance using sensor data.
